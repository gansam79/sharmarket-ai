"Create a complete authentication and client management system with the following features:

1. Authentication

Login Screen: Form with Email/Username and Password. Include 'Forgot Password' link. Show error alerts for wrong credentials.

Forgot Password: Send reset link/OTP by email. Allow secure password reset.

New Client Registration: When a client is added, automatically:

Create an entry in both Client table and User table.

Generate fields: id, username, name, email, password (hashed), phone number, createdAt.

Auto-generate username and password if not provided.

Send email with login credentials (username, email, password).

2. Roles & Permissions

Client: Can log in, view/update their own profile, and change/reset their password.

Employee: Can log in and view assigned clients only.

Admin: Full system access. Can:

View all users and clients.

Edit details, reset passwords, assign/change roles.

See all user passwords in plain text (unhashed) on an Admin-only User Management screen.

3. Client Profile Details Page

Show Profile ID (e.g., 68df4c4d7f10e0a3a70d5579).

Add a Review Mode toggle (switch profile into read-only view).

Add a Print button to print profile details.

Add an Export button to download the profileâ€™s full details in Excel format.

4. All Clients List Page

Show searchable, paginated client table.

Include an Export All button to export all client profiles in Excel format.

Each row should have actions: View, Edit, Delete, Export.

5. Admin Dashboard

Admin sees tables for Users and Clients.

Admin can: Edit user/client details, reset passwords, assign roles.

Admin can export all users and clients to Excel.

Add a User Management section in the sidebar where Admin can see all users with plain-text passwords.

6. UI & Security

Use modern, responsive design with a left-hand sidebar navigation: Dashboard, Clients, Profiles, DMAT, Shareholders, User Management.

Use rounded cards, soft shadows, and clean layout.

Show notifications for success/error after login, registration, profile updates, export, or password reset.

Store passwords securely (hashed) in the database, but allow Admin role to view the real plain password in their dashboard.

Build this as a full authentication and client management system with role-based access control, client profiles, export/print features, and an Admin-only User Management section that shows real passwords."
